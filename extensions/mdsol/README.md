# Medidata ODM Extensions Sample

There are two sample ODM documents in this folder:
* [mediflex_odm.xml](./mediflex_odm.xml) - default metadata extraction from Medidata Rave
* [mediflex_vff.xml](./mediflex_vff.xml) - Version Folders with Forms extract 

The default metadata extract for Rave will only extract the Default Matrix (The Matrix is the initial set of forms/visits that are instantiated when a subject is enrolled); the VFF is a configurable dataset that overlays the groupings from the different matrices (which could be viewed as StudyEventGroups)
