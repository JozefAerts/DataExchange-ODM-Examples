# ODM Examples

This repository provides a place for the ODM Team to create and curate examples that may eventually find their way into a standard. All the examples contribute to standards development discussions, and some may be curated and moved to the official [ODM repository](https://github.com/cdisc-org/DataExchange-ODM) for inclusion in a publication. Feel free to add any examples you think benefit our standards development discussions.
